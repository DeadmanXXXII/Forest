# Forest
Rigetti computing quantum CLI

### **1. Forest Installation**

Ensure you have Forest installed:
```bash
pip install pyquil
```

### **2. General Forest CLI Commands**

While Forest (pyQuil) does not have a dedicated CLI like Qiskit, you interact with it using Python scripts executed from the command line. Below are some common tasks performed with Forest using Python scripts.

### **3. Running Forest Scripts**

Create a Python script (`my_circuit.py`) that uses Forest:
```python
from pyquil import Program, get_qc
from pyquil.gates import H, CNOT, MEASURE

# Create a quantum program
p = Program()
ro = p.declare('ro', 'BIT', 2)

# Define a quantum circuit
p += H(0)
p += CNOT(0, 1)
p += MEASURE(0, ro[0])
p += MEASURE(1, ro[1])

# Get a quantum computer
qc = get_qc('2q-qvm')

# Run the program
result = qc.run_and_measure(p, trials=10)
print(result)
```

Run the script from the command line:
```bash
python my_circuit.py
```

### **4. Forest Simulation and Execution**

- **Simulate a quantum circuit:**
  ```python
  from pyquil import Program, get_qc
  from pyquil.gates import H, CNOT, MEASURE

  # Create a quantum program
  p = Program()
  ro = p.declare('ro', 'BIT', 2)

  # Define a quantum circuit
  p += H(0)
  p += CNOT(0, 1)
  p += MEASURE(0, ro[0])
  p += MEASURE(1, ro[1])

  # Get a quantum computer simulator
  qc = get_qc('2q-qvm')

  # Run the program
  result = qc.run_and_measure(p, trials=10)
  print(result)
  ```

Run the simulation script:
```bash
python simulate_circuit.py
```

### **5. Advanced Execution and Simulation Options**

- **Run a circuit on a quantum computer:**
  ```python
  from pyquil import Program, get_qc
  from pyquil.gates import H, CNOT, MEASURE

  # Create a quantum program
  p = Program()
  ro = p.declare('ro', 'BIT', 2)

  # Define a quantum circuit
  p += H(0)
  p += CNOT(0, 1)
  p += MEASURE(0, ro[0])
  p += MEASURE(1, ro[1])

  # Get a quantum computer (real device)
  qc = get_qc('Aspen-9')

  # Run the program
  result = qc.run_and_measure(p, trials=10)
  print(result)
  ```

### **6. Managing and Listing Devices**

- **List available quantum devices:**
  ```python
  from pyquil.api import get_devices

  devices = get_devices()
  for device in devices:
      print(device)
  ```

- **Get details of a specific device:**
  ```python
  from pyquil.api import get_qc

  qc = get_qc('Aspen-9')
  print(qc)
  ```

### **7. Forest Optimizations and Transformations**

- **Optimize a quantum circuit:**
  ```python
  from pyquil import Program
  from pyquil.gates import H, X, Y

  # Create a quantum program
  p = Program()
  p += H(0)
  p += X(0)
  p += Y(0)

  # Optimize the program
  optimized_program = p.optimize()
  print(optimized_program)
  ```

### **8. Working with Quil Files**

- **Export circuit to Quil:**
  ```python
  from pyquil import Program
  from pyquil.gates import H, MEASURE

  # Create a quantum program
  p = Program()
  p += H(0)
  p += MEASURE(0)

  # Export to Quil
  with open('circuit.quil', 'w') as f:
      f.write(p.out())
  ```

- **Import circuit from Quil:**
  ```python
  from pyquil import Program

  # Import from Quil
  with open('circuit.quil', 'r') as f:
      quil_str = f.read()

  program = Program(quil_str)
  print(program)
  ```

### **9. Using Forest from Jupyter Notebooks**

You can also run Forest commands in Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and visualization.

- **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
  ```bash
  pip install notebook
  ```

- **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- **Run Forest in a notebook cell:**
  ```python
  from pyquil import Program, get_qc
  from pyquil.gates import H, MEASURE

  # Create a quantum program
  p = Program()
  p += H(0)
  p += MEASURE(0)

  # Get a quantum computer simulator
  qc = get_qc('1q-qvm')

  # Run the program
  result = qc.run_and_measure(p, trials=10)
  print(result)
  ```

### **10. Miscellaneous Commands**

- **Set parameters in a quantum program:**
  ```python
  from pyquil import Program
  from pyquil.gates import RX, MEASURE
  import numpy as np

  # Create a quantum program with a parameter
  p = Program()
  theta = np.pi / 2
  p += RX(theta, 0)
  p += MEASURE(0)

  print(p)
  ```

- **Compile a quantum program:**
  ```python
  from pyquil import Program, get_qc
  from pyquil.gates import H, MEASURE

  # Create a quantum program
  p = Program()
  p += H(0)
  p += MEASURE(0)

  # Get a quantum computer
  qc = get_qc('1q-qvm')

  # Compile the program
  executable = qc.compile(p)
  print(executable)
  ```
